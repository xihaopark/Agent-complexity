This workflow performs **differential gene expression** and **isoform splicing analysis** on Nanopore long-read RNA-Seq data using [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2), [Salmon](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon), and [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html).

Isoform-level detection, quantification, and differential expression analysis are integrated via [FLAIR](https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/flair). Protein annotation, for example when ontological data are missing, is performed using [Lambda](https://github.com/seqan/lambda).

## Usage
