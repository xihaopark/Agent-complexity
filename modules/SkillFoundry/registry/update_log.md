# Update Log

## 2026-03-22

- Added `skills/proteomics/protein-language-model-function-analysis-starter` as a concrete `sandbox_verified` bridge between protein embedding extraction and sequence-to-function triage, with a deterministic mock backend, optional ESM-2 or ProtT5 upgrade path, and a Slurm batch template.
- Added four canonical protein-language-model resources to `registry/resources.jsonl` and `registry/resources_dedup.jsonl`: Transformers ESM docs, the foundational ESM paper, the ProtTrans paper, and the ProtT5 model card.
- Added a repo-level smoke target and smoke test for the new protein language model starter, then committed bundled toy FASTA, labels, config, and starter outputs.
- Revalidated the updated surface with `python3 scripts/validate_repository.py`, `python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/proteomics/protein-language-model-function-analysis-starter/tests -p 'test_*.py'`, `python3 -m unittest tests.smoke.test_protein_language_model_function_analysis_starter`, `python3 skills/proteomics/protein-language-model-function-analysis-starter/scripts/run_frontier_starter.py --out scratch/protein-lm/frontier_summary.json`, `make smoke-protein-language-models`, and `python3 scripts/build_site.py`.

- Promoted `skills/genomics/gwas-starter` from a frontier-plan placeholder to a concrete `sandbox_verified` GWAS summary-statistics QC starter that reads tabular sumstats, writes a flagged TSV, and emits downstream interpretation recommendations.
- Added five canonical GWAS resources to `registry/resources.jsonl` and `registry/resources_dedup.jsonl`: the GIANT meta-analysis QC protocol, LDSC, FUMA, GWASLab, and GWAS Catalog summary-statistics documentation.
- Regenerated the bundled GWAS example outputs under `skills/genomics/gwas-starter/assets/` and kept the compatibility wrapper `run_frontier_starter.py` delegating to the new runnable QC path.
- Revalidated the updated surface with `python3 scripts/validate_repository.py`, `python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/genomics/gwas-starter/tests -p 'test_*.py'`, `python3 skills/genomics/gwas-starter/scripts/run_frontier_starter.py --out scratch/gwas/frontier_wrapper_summary.json`, `python3 scripts/build_site.py`, and `python3 -m unittest tests.integration.test_build_site`.

## 2026-03-21

- Re-ran the repository refresh surface and rebuilt the generated site outputs without changing the taxonomy, resource registry, or skill registry, keeping the repository at `366` deduplicated resources, `266` skills, `254` covered leaves, `0` frontier-only leaves, and `0` pure TODO leaves.
- Re-ran `scripts/close_frontier_leaves.py`, which correctly stayed a no-op because the taxonomy is still fully skill-backed.
- Refreshed the shared review outputs with a clean `audit_skill_suite` pass, a `266/266` dry-run smoke-matrix mapping, and a six-case benchmark sample spanning GWAS, proteomics, privacy-preserving analysis, pseudobulk analysis, and interface analysis.
- Re-ran `python3 -m unittest tests.integration.test_build_site tests.integration.test_skill_review_scripts tests.integration.test_sciskill_framework`, which passed `52` tests and kept the framework-facing refresh surface green.

- Re-ran `scripts/close_frontier_leaves.py`, which correctly stayed a no-op because the taxonomy is still fully skill-backed.
- Revalidated the structural surface with `scripts/validate_repository.py` and `scripts/audit_skill_suite.py`, which stayed at `0` hard failures, `266/266` smoke-covered skills, and `253/266` skills with local tests.
- Refreshed `scripts/run_skill_smoke_matrix.py` in `--dry-run` mode, preserving an honest `266/266` target-mapping snapshot without claiming full-suite execution.
- Executed the current `12` focus-leaf starter smokes directly, covering the surfaced proteomics, geospatial, GWAS, and symbolic-discovery starters and writing fresh `scratch/frontier/*.json` artifacts.
- Ran a targeted `12`-case `scripts/benchmark_skill_advantage.py` suite spanning GWAS, proteomics, climate reanalysis, single-cell planning, and multiome integration; maintained skills matched baseline success while improving mean deliverable rate from `0.583` to `1.0`.
- Rebuilt site data through `scripts/build_site.py`, keeping the tree totals unchanged while refreshing `site/framework_runs.json` to surface `16` framework runs.
- Updated the planning files, `registry/coverage_report.md`, `registry/update_log.md`, and `reports/refresh-runs/20260321-050747-cycle/summary.md` so the on-disk refresh snapshot matches the executed checks.

- Re-ran the repository refresh surface after the current framework changes without expanding the registry, confirming the repository remains at `366` deduplicated resources, `266` skills, `254` covered leaves, `0` frontier-only leaves, and `0` pure TODO leaves.

- Re-ran `python3 -m unittest tests.integration.test_sciskill_framework tests.integration.test_skill_review_scripts -v`, which passed `22` selected integration tests and confirmed that the refresh-owned script surface remains consistent with the new campaign-runner and evaluation changes.
- Rebuilt site data through `scripts/build_site.py`, keeping the tree totals unchanged while refreshing `site/framework_runs.json` to surface `12` framework runs, all still counted conservatively under `attention`.
- Kept the carry-forward implementation queue centered on `differential-proteomics`, `ms-proteomics-preprocessing`, `sequence-to-function-modeling`, `protein-embeddings`, `protein-identification-quantification`, `spatial-transcriptomics`, `pseudobulk-analysis`, `rna-velocity`, `gwas`, `fine-mapping`, `privacy-preserving-analysis`, and `regulatory-network-inference`.

- Recorded that `single-cell-rna-seq-preprocessing` and `single-cell-integration-batch-correction` are already verified, so the next transcriptomics queue should stay on `spatial-transcriptomics`, `pseudobulk-analysis`, and `rna-velocity`.
- Recorded that broad `legal` and `policy` focus terms still collapse onto `privacy-preserving-analysis`, so the next cycle should keep explicit privacy or regulatory terms rather than changing framework ranking during tree-check.

## 2026-03-20

- Re-ran the repository tree-check surface without expanding the registry, confirming the repository remains at `366` deduplicated resources, `266` skills, `254` covered leaves, `0` frontier-only leaves, and `0` pure TODO leaves.
- Rebuilt site data through `scripts/build_site.py` and refreshed the focused framework-status snapshot under `reports/tree-check-20260320-cycle/framework_status.json`.
- Revalidated the structural review surface with `scripts/audit_skill_suite.py`, which stayed at `0` hard failures, `266/266` smoke-covered skills, and `253/266` skills with local tests.
- Revalidated the smoke-matrix mapping with `scripts/run_skill_smoke_matrix.py --dry-run`, which still resolved `266/266` skill targets with no failures or missing mappings.
- Re-ran the `fastqc-multiqc-read-qc` representative benchmark and confirmed the maintained wrapper still outperforms the no-skill baseline on deliverable rate while preserving command success.
- Recorded that the current post-zero-TODO backlog is now the `146`-skill implemented queue, with `145` covered leaves still lacking any verified skill.

- Noted a focus-term caveat for future cycles: broad terms like `spatial` and `legal` pull lexically valid but lower-priority leaves ahead of spatial omics and privacy/regulatory work, so the next cycle should narrow its focus terms instead of changing framework logic during tree-check.

## 2026-03-15
